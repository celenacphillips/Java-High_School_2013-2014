This is a list of all the programs I coded and learned with in the second class. All code does compile and run. **And unlike the first class, I was only given prompts for this class and told to program. So all this code is unique.**

**If there are multiple files in a folder, run the file with the folder name. Similarly, there may be applications and applets of the same program in the same folder. You can run either of those.**
