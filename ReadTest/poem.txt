The cold

And the cold wind blows.
And the frigid air surrounds me,
Trapping me in an abyss of ice
That not even warming thoughts can break.
In this void, there is no light, no hope, no love.
I feel the usual numbness overtake me.
The chill reaches and stays with my bones,
An everlasting feeling that rarely leaves.
An image of the blazing sun flashes through my mind,
But that isn’t even enough 
To bring me from the freezing depths of misery.
My body uncontrollably shakes violently with shivers
As I clutch what I can to stay warm.
With much defeat, I give in to the spiteful weather
And collapse into a lifeless heap on the ground,
Surrounded by lightly falling snow.
And I shudder once.
Then, as if upon cue, 
Death kisses my lips and embraces me in his midnight cloak.
